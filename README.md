# Counter #

Counter is a simple app showing the basics of the [VIPER](http://mutualmobile.github.io/blog/2013/12/04/viper-introduction/) architecture, a version of Uncle Bob’s Clean Architecture for iOS apps. Counter shows the use of a View, Presenter and Interactor. It does not make use of a data store or a Wireframe for navigation.

The inspiration for Counter comes from Jon Reid’s UIViewController TDD [screencast](http://qualitycoding.org/uiviewcontroller-tdd/).
